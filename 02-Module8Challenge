/*
Module 8 Challenge: SQL Statements
*/

/*
Instructions:
For this challenge, we'll be retrieving, sorting, and 
filtering data from the Northwind Database. 
We'll also insert records, update, and delete records.


Use the Northwind database for this assignment. Use the
instructions in the comments to write the SQL statements
for this assignment.
 
Run and test your SQL code using the sqlcmd command in the Terminal.
Here's an example: 
sqlcmd -S localhost -U sa -P P@ssw0rd -d Northwind -Q "SELECT * FROM Customers;"
*/


USE Northwind;

/*
1.	
Retrieve a list of products. 
The list should include the product name, unit price, 
and how many units Northwind has in stock.
*/
sqlcmd -S localhost -U sa -P P@ssw0rd -d Northwind -Q "SELECT ProductName, UnitPrice, UnitsInStock FROM Products";
/
*2.	
List the product name and units in stock for products where UnitsInStock equals zero.
*/
sqlcmd -S localhost -U sa -P P@ssw0rd -d Northwind -Q "SELECT ProductName, UnitsInStock FROM Products WHERE UnitsInStock = 0;"
/*
3.	List the product name and the unit price for each product. 
Sort the list with the smallest unit price on top.
*/
sqlcmd -S localhost -U sa -P P@ssw0rd -d Northwind -Q "SELECT ProductName, UnitPrice FROM Products ORDER BY UnitPrice;"

/*
4.	List all products with the brand "Sir Rodney's" in the product name. 
*/
sqlcmd -S localhost -U sa -P P@ssw0rd -d Northwind -Q "SELECT * FROM Products WHERE ProductName LIKE 'Sir Rodney%';"

/*
5.	Create a list of product names and product IDs for products 
with supplier ID 20. Order by product name. */
sqlcmd -S localhost -U sa -P P@ssw0rd -d Northwind -Q "SELECT ProductName, ProductID FROM Products WHERE SupplierID = 20 ORDER BY ProductName;"
/*
6.	List the product ID and product name for products with 
zero units on order. Order by product ID. 
*/
sqlcmd -S localhost -U sa -P P@ssw0rd -d Northwind -Q "SELECT ProductID, ProductName FROM Products WHERE UnitsOnOrder = 0 ORDER BY ProductID;"
/*
7. Your boss has asked you for a list of orders for
       the employee Janet Leverling. 
       The list should contain the order ID, the company name
	   of the customer, and the name of the employee who
	   helped place the order.
       (Hint: Use a JOIN to retrieve data from more than one table.)

	- Manager as the ContactTitle
	- 123 Sesame Street as the address

13. Insert a new record into the Categories table. 
Insert the values 'Ice Cream'and 'Frosty desserts' into the 
CategoryName and Description columns. You don't need to insert
a value into the CategoryID column because that it auto-populated.
You don't need to insert a value into the Picture column 
because it is optional.
